              In the 1790s, Boston, then a growing town on the Shawmut Peninsula, began its early land-making efforts to expand its limited area. Initial projects like filling Mill Pond were modest but laid the foundation for future expansions that would dramatically change the city's landscape.

              By the 1830s, Boston's population had increased to about 61,000. The city’s physical expansion continued as land-making projects progressed, transforming the city's geography. Notably, the Mill Pond area was completely filled by 1828, and attention turned to the South Cove, which was filled to create new land for the burgeoning city. This period witnessed the transformation of Boston's coastline, with the filled lands soon hosting residential buildings and commercial enterprises, aiding in the city’s economic growth.

                The population soared to 180,000 by the 1860s, driven by industrialization and the influx of immigrants. The land-making efforts kept pace, with major projects like the filling of the Back Bay starting in 1857. This massive undertaking was critical in creating the now prestigious Back Bay neighborhood, drastically increasing Boston’s land mass and property value. By the end of this period, Boston had not only expanded its land but had also laid down the infrastructural foundation for modern urban development.

                By the 1910s, Boston's population had reached 670,000, and the city's skyline began to take on a more contemporary form. The completion of the Back Bay and Fenway land-making projects had created significant new residential and commercial areas. This era marked the culmination of Boston's most intensive period of land filling, which saw the city's geography and real estate market transformed. The development of these new areas helped accommodate the growing population and facilitated economic activities that leveraged the newly available space.

      <center>
        <h3> Boston and Flooding </h3>
        <br>
        <p>In Boston, the practice of land reclamation is closely intertwined with the ongoing housing shortage and escalating flooding risks. Historically, the city has delineated solid ground from the transient and often undervalued marshlands, which were traditionally seen as "filthy" and "ambiguous." This process has not only shaped the physical landscape but has also influenced the economic valuations and speculations concerning property development.<br><br>

        Marshlands naturally function as hydrological buffers—they absorb water when conditions are wet and release it during drier periods. This ecological role is critical in managing coastal flooding by mitigating the impact of storm surges and high tides. However, Boston’s extensive land reclamation efforts have involved filling these natural buffers, thereby significantly reducing their capacity to manage water flow.<br><br>

        The consequences of these actions are profound. Coastal areas in Boston are increasingly susceptible to flooding, a problem exacerbated by climate change and rising sea levels. This situation represents a paradox where the drive for urban expansion and economic gain undermines the very land's ability to protect itself and its inhabitants from natural disasters.<br><br>

        Various stakeholders, including environmentalists, urban planners, and community activists, have <a href="https://www.inundationdistrict.com/about-the-film" target="_blank">voiced concerns over the relentless investment in reclaimed lands.</a> They argue that the city’s development strategies need a reevaluation that considers the long-term sustainability against flooding.</p>

        <h4>The least you can do to protect yourself is to see if you have a flood insurance.</h4><br>

This program offered homeowners affordable flood insurance because private companies were unwilling to take on the risk of damage caused by floods. The program is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</h4><br>
        <h4>Rates vary depending on:
          <li>The flood zone your property is located in</li>

          <h8>With the prospect of looming sea level rise and heightened flood risk throughout Boston,
            we expect that the buying and selling of properties would account for this near term risk.</h8>
          <br>
          <br>
          However, despite overall property sales remaining consistent, we note that two categories <u>Special Flood Hazard Area</u>
          and <u>9" Sea Level Rise</u> are actually increasing in the last four years.
          <br>
          <br>
          Similarly, we see that these zones are where more new properties are being built.

        <h8>Has property speculation not been accounting for sea-level rise?</h8>
        <br>
        <br>
        It's well known that buying and selling property is lucrative investment practice, but increasingly,
        the practice of flipping means that people are buying and selling properties within a shorter timespan.
        <br>
        <br>
        By counting which unique addresses are most frequently sold, we can analyze the impact of this
        property speculation on properties falling within the different spatial risk zones.
        <br>
        <br>
        Surprisingly, we find that across the categories, spatial risk has little to no correlation with how frequently a property is sold.
        This means that so far in the twenty-first century, flood risk has not been driving market behavior.
        How sustainable can this practice be?

      <h7 style="text-align: left;">
        <br><br><br>
        The properties most prone to near term flood risk are those we would associate with "waterfront" communities such
        as North End, East Boston, and Seaport.
        <br>
        <br>
        As these properties are highly sought over for their convenient central locations, we also see that their prices
        are higher on average compared to the Boston Market.
        <br>
        <br>
        This trend appears in this chart as a diagonal clustering of properties between the $1-5 million price range.
        <br>
        Alarmingly, a smaller cluster appears in the row of properties sold 6 times or more, which are priced below $1 million.
        These more affordable properties which are traded at a high frequency and face near term flood risk are potentially dangerous
        for homebuyers entering the market.

        All property types will face some exposure to flood risk in the coming century,
        but condominiums and apartments in particular face heightened risk.
        <br>
        <br>
        By 2070, in the 36" Sea-Level Rise scenario, more than 20% of condominiums and 15% of apartments in Boston
